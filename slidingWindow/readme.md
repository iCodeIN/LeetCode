76. Minimum window substring: 

```Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).```

In fact, this can be interpreted as "at least one occurrence of all chars of T in S".

sliding window: essence **at least/at most K times**

If it's exactly K times, it's different. But not too different.
