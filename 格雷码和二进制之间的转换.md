#### Finding Gray Code

| Num | Binary| Gray |
| --- |:----:| -----:|
| 1   | 000  | 000  |
| 2   | 001  | 001  |
| 3   | 010  | 011  |
| 4   | 100  | 110  |
| 5   | 101  | 111  |
| 6   | 110  | 101  |
| 7   | 111  | 100  |

Bits of number ```n``` and bits of number ```G(n)```:

```i```th bit of ```G(n)``` equals 1 only when ```i```th bit of ```n``` equals ```1``` and ```i+1```th bit equals 0, 
or the other way round; i.e. ```i```th and ```i+1```th bit of ```n``` differ => ```i```th bit of G(n) is 1.

```
int g(int n) {
    return n ^ (n >> 1);
}
```

#### Finding inverse Gray Code

Given Gray code ```g```, restore the original number n.
```
int rev_g (int g) {
  int n = 0;
  for (; g; g >>= 1)
    n ^= g;
  return n;
}
```
